This site uses the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) Jekyll theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). I set it up for the most part by simply forking Hyde into my Github Pages root. I also got some help from [this page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) (and others too numerous to mention).
